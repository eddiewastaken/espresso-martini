# The Espresso Martini

My most up to date Martini recipe.

# Ingredients/Equipment

* 50ml Freshly Brewed Espresso
* 50ml Coffee Liqueur
* 50ml Vodka
* 5ml Simple Syrup (1:1 Sugar/Water)
* Ice to shake
* Loose Coffee Beans (optional, to garnish)
* Shaker and Strainer
* Martini Glass or Champagne Saucer

## Method

Into the shaker, add the double espresso shot, coffee liquer, sugar syrup and vodka. Add a small amount of the ice to cool the mix. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds. Strain into glass slowly, making sure to top with the foam that has collected in the remainder of the shaker.

Garnish with three coffee beans.

## Notes

* **5ml of Simple Syrup is exactly a teaspoon, so measuring spoons can come in very handy here.**
* **The 5ml of Simple Syrup can be doubled or even removed depending on your taste. This is largely based on the sweetness of your coffee liqueur.**
* **Decaf coffee beans can be used in place of regular beans, to avoid a big caffeine hit in the evening.**
* **In a pinch, instant coffee can be used in place of the freshly brewed espresso. Use 1/2 teaspoon + 50ml (hot) water to substitute. Bear in mind this will significantly alter the flavour of the finished beverage, and not for the better.**
