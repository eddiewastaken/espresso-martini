# The Amaretto Sour

My most up to date Amaretto Sour recipe.

# Ingredients/Equipment

* 50ml Amaretto
* 25ml Lemon Juice
* 5ml Simple Syrup (1:1 Sugar/Water)
* 1 Egg White
* Ice to taste
* Slice of Lemon (optional, to garnish)
* Shaker and Strainer
* Old Fashioned Glass

## Method

Into the shaker, add the Amaretto, lemon juice, simple syrup, approx 1/4 of the ice and the egg white. Shake vigorously for 10-15 seconds. Add the ice to the old fashioned glass, and strain into it.

Garnish with a slice of lemon (optional).

## Notes

* **5ml of Simple Syrup is exactly a teaspoon, so measuring spoons can come in very handy here.**
